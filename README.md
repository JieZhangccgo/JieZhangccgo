- 👋 Hi, I’m Jie Zhang @JieZhangccgo
- 👀 I’m interested in reactions and transport processes in the soil 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nitrification/denitrification processes in the real world and code version control with the help of Git/Github 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on writing a reactive transport model (checking & debugging) and parameterisation (parameter ranges & optimization).
